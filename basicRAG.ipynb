The last stations were available in 2014 #60050 (423 pieces, $65US) and prior to that 2010&#39;s offering #7937 (361 pieces, $50).&nbsp; I was not collecting LEGO at that time and eventually acquired them on the aftermarket a few years ago for a higher price, due to wanting a sealed box for each.&nbsp;&nbsp;This year&#39;s set consists of 907 pieces and costs $100.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I feel that comparing this year to prior offerings will give a sense of value over the past dozen years.&nbsp; Comparing just station vs station - you can see from the pictures below, they are roughly the same size.&nbsp; Each came with 4 pieces of railroad track as well.&nbsp; The 2014 set has a larger platform, but about the same size of structure when compared to 2022.&nbsp; 2010 was much smaller and was mostly built to accommodate the extensive staircases/platform to cross the track.&nbsp; The prior 2 stations, both came with a small yellow taxi.&nbsp; This years set, comes with a bus, a rail truck, tow sled with port-a-potty and a road plate with manual crossing lights/barriers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>[img]https://i.imgur.com/2aY3P3O.jpg[/img]</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>[img]https://i.imgur.com/DHcKAEB.jpg[/img]</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This year&#39;s design/color scheme definitely was made to match a few of this year&#39;s other town/city set offerings, which include the #60347 Grocery Store, #60345 Farmers Market Van &amp; #60337 Express Passenger Train.&nbsp; All of them have the green/white/teal colour schemes and have references to &quot;Fresh&quot; grocery store branding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Functionally, the new set does not have an overhang over the tracks - which is done on purpose, as the new freight train #60336 has a car transporter that is much taller than standard train cars have been built!&nbsp; This particular train car would definitely smash into the prior 2 iterations of these train stations from earlier years.&nbsp; It does have a nice wheelchair accessible ramp, a bike rack and the standard ticket counter and snack bar/caf&eacute;.&nbsp; Plus a second level control tower.&nbsp; Also, as a wonderful bonus, there is a new street plate and attachments.&nbsp; Also included in the build, are&nbsp;the manual crossing gates that you can raise/lower on each side of the tracks.&nbsp; They are secured with a technic friction pin, so they will stay at whatever angle you want them at and not fall closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The overall look to this year&#39;s station is very nice!&nbsp; I love how the roof/skylights were built and flow through the whole station.&nbsp; It gives a very modern and sleek look.&nbsp; Plus, a nice bench, tree and ATM are at the far end of the platform, nearby a triangular mosaic that hangs on the wall.&nbsp; The platform as a whole, feels very sturdy when transporting it as well.&nbsp; My one minor complaint with the structure comes down to the details with the caf&eacute;!&nbsp; It&#39;s so sparse.&nbsp; ONE whole croissant is available for purchase.&nbsp; There was ample room to provide more snacks or a place to sit.&nbsp; I feel that this is a missed opportunity that the prior sets address well, for limited space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Another build with this set is a city bus.&nbsp; I was surprised to look back through city offerings and not really find much in the way of buses through the years!&nbsp; I have 3 others, from prior year sets, but only one of those was a standalone offering.&nbsp; The other 2 came in quite expensive, mutli-build, conglomerate city sets.&nbsp; So not exactly a cheap LEGO vehicle to acquire.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>2018 set Capital City #60200 ($150US) has a red, double-decker, sightseeing bus.&nbsp; 2013 Town Square #60026 ($120)&nbsp;has a standard red bus.&nbsp; And 2017 has&nbsp;the #60154 Bus Station ($50) bus, in yellow.&nbsp; The train bus is closest in size, to the yellow bus, though that is a few studs longer.&nbsp; But it has a nice bike rack on the back and has much easier access to play with the interior than the yellow bus, as the roof pieces come off easily, in 3 parts.&nbsp; I&#39;ve actually modified the yellow bus for my daughter, because it is so difficult to remove the top panels on that particular model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>[img]https://i.imgur.com/2vZCWsz.jpg[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/IKEvtn1.jpg[/img]</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The final item to build with this set, is a handy, utility, rail truck.&nbsp; The only other instance of this particular type vehicle that I could find, goes clear back to set #7936, from 2010.&nbsp; At the time, it cost $20US, but trying to find one now will cost up to $100 in some cases to find, still sealed!&nbsp; This handy truck, not only can drive on standard roads, but it has front and back rail wheels that can lower/raise in order to drive on rail tracks.&nbsp; It comes with a small lift on the back and has a small sled attachment, which carries a port-a-potty with it!&nbsp; My daughter spent endless hours playing with this and racing the &quot;poop truck&quot; around with our trains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The overall build is very straightforward, from the station, the bus, the rail truck and port-a-john.&nbsp; I would say that any age would enjoy putting together this set.&nbsp; Pieces are pretty standard - some new colours for a few, which is always nice, but the standout piece is the rail ramps&nbsp;- a hard to find piece (#6404467), only available in a set once before.&nbsp; And with this set, you get 2.&nbsp; They are very handy to help re-rail any of your trains/train cars, and I&#39;m glad to have multiple of this piece.&nbsp; Other handy pieces are the new wider, window/door frames and the smaller clear doors that fit into them.&nbsp; Those are a much newer part and work well when putting a side by side door that allows for wheelchair access to either the bus or the train station.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For $100, I thought this train station has great value.&nbsp; Just getting the station by itself is probably around $50, but then you are adding in a robust bus, and the rail truck, wagon, crossings and road plate.&nbsp; Plus 6 mini figures.&nbsp; Its a great deal by todays standards.&nbsp; The best of which is the truck driver, who has reflective type coat and hard hat on!&nbsp; Those are new to us and look brilliant!&nbsp; I just wish there were a few more figures to work/use the bus/train station.&nbsp; But we have plenty in our LEGO city to fill that void.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n', 'HTML': True}]}\n"
