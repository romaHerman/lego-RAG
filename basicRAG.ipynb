The last stations were available in 2014 #60050 (423 pieces, $65US) and prior to that 2010&#39;s offering #7937 (361 pieces, $50).&nbsp; I was not collecting LEGO at that time and eventually acquired them on the aftermarket a few years ago for a higher price, due to wanting a sealed box for each.&nbsp;&nbsp;This year&#39;s set consists of 907 pieces and costs $100.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I feel that comparing this year to prior offerings will give a sense of value over the past dozen years.&nbsp; Comparing just station vs station - you can see from the pictures below, they are roughly the same size.&nbsp; Each came with 4 pieces of railroad track as well.&nbsp; The 2014 set has a larger platform, but about the same size of structure when compared to 2022.&nbsp; 2010 was much smaller and was mostly built to accommodate the extensive staircases/platform to cross the track.&nbsp; The prior 2 stations, both came with a small yellow taxi.&nbsp; This years set, comes with a bus, a rail truck, tow sled with port-a-potty and a road plate with manual crossing lights/barriers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>[img]https://i.imgur.com/2aY3P3O.jpg[/img]</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>[img]https://i.imgur.com/DHcKAEB.jpg[/img]</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This year&#39;s design/color scheme definitely was made to match a few of this year&#39;s other town/city set offerings, which include the #60347 Grocery Store, #60345 Farmers Market Van &amp; #60337 Express Passenger Train.&nbsp; All of them have the green/white/teal colour schemes and have references to &quot;Fresh&quot; grocery store branding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Functionally, the new set does not have an overhang over the tracks - which is done on purpose, as the new freight train #60336 has a car transporter that is much taller than standard train cars have been built!&nbsp; This particular train car would definitely smash into the prior 2 iterations of these train stations from earlier years.&nbsp; It does have a nice wheelchair accessible ramp, a bike rack and the standard ticket counter and snack bar/caf&eacute;.&nbsp; Plus a second level control tower.&nbsp; Also, as a wonderful bonus, there is a new street plate and attachments.&nbsp; Also included in the build, are&nbsp;the manual crossing gates that you can raise/lower on each side of the tracks.&nbsp; They are secured with a technic friction pin, so they will stay at whatever angle you want them at and not fall closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The overall look to this year&#39;s station is very nice!&nbsp; I love how the roof/skylights were built and flow through the whole station.&nbsp; It gives a very modern and sleek look.&nbsp; Plus, a nice bench, tree and ATM are at the far end of the platform, nearby a triangular mosaic that hangs on the wall.&nbsp; The platform as a whole, feels very sturdy when transporting it as well.&nbsp; My one minor complaint with the structure comes down to the details with the caf&eacute;!&nbsp; It&#39;s so sparse.&nbsp; ONE whole croissant is available for purchase.&nbsp; There was ample room to provide more snacks or a place to sit.&nbsp; I feel that this is a missed opportunity that the prior sets address well, for limited space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Another build with this set is a city bus.&nbsp; I was surprised to look back through city offerings and not really find much in the way of buses through the years!&nbsp; I have 3 others, from prior year sets, but only one of those was a standalone offering.&nbsp; The other 2 came in quite expensive, mutli-build, conglomerate city sets.&nbsp; So not exactly a cheap LEGO vehicle to acquire.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>2018 set Capital City #60200 ($150US) has a red, double-decker, sightseeing bus.&nbsp; 2013 Town Square #60026 ($120)&nbsp;has a standard red bus.&nbsp; And 2017 has&nbsp;the #60154 Bus Station ($50) bus, in yellow.&nbsp; The train bus is closest in size, to the yellow bus, though that is a few studs longer.&nbsp; But it has a nice bike rack on the back and has much easier access to play with the interior than the yellow bus, as the roof pieces come off easily, in 3 parts.&nbsp; I&#39;ve actually modified the yellow bus for my daughter, because it is so difficult to remove the top panels on that particular model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>[img]https://i.imgur.com/2vZCWsz.jpg[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/IKEvtn1.jpg[/img]</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The final item to build with this set, is a handy, utility, rail truck.&nbsp; The only other instance of this particular type vehicle that I could find, goes clear back to set #7936, from 2010.&nbsp; At the time, it cost $20US, but trying to find one now will cost up to $100 in some cases to find, still sealed!&nbsp; This handy truck, not only can drive on standard roads, but it has front and back rail wheels that can lower/raise in order to drive on rail tracks.&nbsp; It comes with a small lift on the back and has a small sled attachment, which carries a port-a-potty with it!&nbsp; My daughter spent endless hours playing with this and racing the &quot;poop truck&quot; around with our trains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The overall build is very straightforward, from the station, the bus, the rail truck and port-a-john.&nbsp; I would say that any age would enjoy putting together this set.&nbsp; Pieces are pretty standard - some new colours for a few, which is always nice, but the standout piece is the rail ramps&nbsp;- a hard to find piece (#6404467), only available in a set once before.&nbsp; And with this set, you get 2.&nbsp; They are very handy to help re-rail any of your trains/train cars, and I&#39;m glad to have multiple of this piece.&nbsp; Other handy pieces are the new wider, window/door frames and the smaller clear doors that fit into them.&nbsp; Those are a much newer part and work well when putting a side by side door that allows for wheelchair access to either the bus or the train station.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For $100, I thought this train station has great value.&nbsp; Just getting the station by itself is probably around $50, but then you are adding in a robust bus, and the rail truck, wagon, crossings and road plate.&nbsp; Plus 6 mini figures.&nbsp; Its a great deal by todays standards.&nbsp; The best of which is the truck driver, who has reflective type coat and hard hat on!&nbsp; Those are new to us and look brilliant!&nbsp; I just wish there were a few more figures to work/use the bus/train station.&nbsp; But we have plenty in our LEGO city to fill that void.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n', 'HTML': True}]}\n"

In a way, all that's left is to see an Invisible Man and Hunchbacked Mini-Figure to truly represent the classics.</p>\\r\\n<p>Mr. Good and Evil is quite a mouthful, and he doesn't accurately represent the character he is meant to, in that Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde were two personalities and the potion changed Jeckyl into Hyde, we never saw anything like the print LEGO has given us for him. Still the printing on this character is highly impressive and the Mini-Figure looks great. If anything he almost looks like a man slowly turning into a Zombie.</p>\\r\\n<p>The printing is that of an old-style English Gentleman's suit, one side is pristine and unmarred, complete with the chain of a pocket watch in his pocket. The other side is tattered and torn, showing off the green skin underneath (representing Evil or Hyde I guess.) and his legs have a printed belt on the waist with some more tatters on one side showing green skin again. (The belt is also tattered on one side and worn, truly beautiful attention to detail.)</p>\\r\\n<p>His face is dual printed, similar to Two-Face from Batman and DC Super Heroes, one side is an ordinary yellow skinned Mini-Figure with a large bushy side-burn, the other has some painted green and the ugly face of Mr. Hyde. His hat has some printing showing holes and scuff marks, he's carrying the flask that is meant to represent the potion which transforms him. The flask we've seen before with other Mini-Figures and other sets.</p>\\r\\n<p>Overall I think this Mini-Figure is pretty nifty, but it isn't completely without issues. The green skin on the left-hand side should have really been all the way around instead of stopping to show the yellow once again, unless they'd planned on making it a double-sided head, or given him a different head to make him one or the other, the unfinished green skin only being on the front of the face looks odd. More like scar tissue than showing him with two distinct skin tones. Also, I think the left arm should have had minor printing, perhaps just a tattered hole in it to show some green, or something, might have completed the look of the figure a bit better. Still what is there for printing is just so detailed and full of rich design work, it can't be easy to make as something as small as a Mini-Figure torso look like two seperate costumes. I recommend picking this one up if you can, he'd look great with the past monsters and Monster Fighters sets.</p>\",\n",

There is no back printing on this figure.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The final element of the figure is the purple coloured flask, which adds &nbsp;greatly to the characters, eccentric and sinister appearance.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall certainly a very interesting figure which seems resemble a Lego version of Dr Jekyll and mr Hyde and is one I'd recommend to spooky/horror and Science collectors and also those making a Victorian/Edwardian Lego setting.&nbsp;</div>\",\n",

Was I right to get him, or should I have listened to my bad side?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The packaging for Series 9 is pretty dull, in an uninspiring gray color. Not my favorite. The checklist looks nice, though. &nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Parts</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The parts on this figure aren&#39;t very useful besides his hat and potion, but they look great.

Based on&nbsp;<em>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em>, this figure is both in one! I imagine it&#39;s harder to live in a Two-Face style than to have one consciousness take over, but it&#39;s a very clever way to include both. His hat is the same old top hat, but it has a few scuffs and a tear on it. I like to position the hat so the damage is on the &quot;Mr. Evil&quot; side. His face is terrific, on one side depicting a worried Victorian gentleman with sideburns (&quot;Mr. Good&quot;), and on the other side, a monstrous green man with an evil grimace and a sunken green eye. His torso is done in much the same way, with his left hand being green and the left side of the coat and shirt being torn and damaged. Even the buttons are&nbsp;crooked toward the left! I really wish they had printed the left arm with a rip in the sleeve, though. The pants continue the pattern, with the belt becoming shabby past the buckle and some more rips in the pant legs. He carries the potion of purple liquid that started the transformation.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Overall opinion</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>He&#39;s fantastic! He&#39;s a clever execution of (a) classic character(s), and he works well in a Victorian or Halloween setting. I&#39;d recommend him!</p>\\r\\n',\n",

       "    'review': '<p>The fourteenth minfigure included in LEGO Minifigures Series 9 is Mr. Good and Evil. This character was released way back in 2013, where he cashed in at $2.99. This character includes 6 pieces. Is this figure good, or is he evil? Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So on top of the figure, we have that top hat, and while the piece itself was not new for the figure, getting it with the scuffed up detailing made it exclusive to this character. There is a bit of detail printed at the sides, but there&#39;s no detailing whatsoever at the back of the hat.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Next is the face, which looks good, at the front. I like how Mr. Good has a frown, and some black sideburns. I also like how expressive that eyebrow is. However, my biggest issue with this character comes with Mr. Evil. I wanna star my complaint by gushing about the expression, which looks evil indeed. I really love the black hair at the sides, I love the green eye, and I love the green tint to the face. But when you turn the figure to the side, things really start to fall apart. See, Mr. Evil is only printed at the front, meaning the side, and the back are just plain yellow. There really was no way around that back in 2013, but I think LEGO would&#39;ve been better off not making this figure at all, since that problem is so significant. I mean he&#39;s called Mr. Good and Evil, not Mr. Good and one-half Mr. Evil. The point of this character is that he has a split personality, and if LEGO can&#39;t capture that key aspect, they should&#39;ve left this character alone, and came back to it in a few years.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Moving on from that small rage, we have his torso, and thankfully, it doesn&#39;t have as many issues. I love how one side of it is very upkept and professional, while the other side is ripped, and torn. The vest underneath has some great detail, and I like how one of his hands is green. It would have been great if we got back printing, but no back detailing is included whatsoever.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Next is his legs, which do have a bit of printing on the Mr. Evil half of the character. I like how his pants appear torn, and how some green flesh is showing through.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The last thing to talk about is his accessory, which is just a simple scientific flask. I do like the purple colour inside the bottle, but, despite it being very fitting, there isn&#39;t too much to talk about with that piece.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That is it for this mnifigure! Overall, Series 9 is one of my favourite series&#39; of all time. However, there are three figures in this series I don&#39;t like, those being Roller Derby Girl, Alien Avenger, and sadly, Mr. Good and Evil. I actually adore the concept behind this figure, being as it is based off the notorious Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. But, despite that, the figure severely lacks printing on the side of the head, and it just falls short as whole in comparison to the rest of the series. This character feels like something from Series 4, and I really expect more from Series 9. I am gonna give this character a 2 out of 5.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That is it for this review! Thank you for reading! I hope you enjoyed!</p>\\r\\n',\n",

Not as creative, it isn&rsquo;t hard to turn an octopus into a squid, but it was still a fun build.</span></span></span></span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 11px;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68);\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;\">Super Skunk: This is extremely creative, the Super Skunk build is just all around fun, and it&rsquo;s great to see a mostly purple skunk running around with the Powerpuff Girls. The physical model is really great as a build too, all three models are quite impressive and for the last Team Pack ever made I&rsquo;m pleased to see that all six models are very impressive in design and functionality.</span></span></span></span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 11px;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68);\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;\">PPG Smartphone: Based on the new cartoon reboot, this phone isn&rsquo;t the same as the original, but it&rsquo;s a solid build.

The trio offered with Bubbles are all three highly impressive, imaginatively fun, and work great on and off the Toy Tag.</span></span></span></span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 11px;\"><span style=\"line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(68, 68, 68);\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;\">PPG Smartphone &amp; Alternate Builds: The same can be said here, while I am not a huge fan of the reboot or its design, I do dig the idea of a Smartphone replacing the old Adam West era Batman throwback the original cartoon used.

And with the Powerpuff Girls sets being made available you can get Buttercup as a Minifigure that way if you still want her without needing to get the Dimensions set for her. Strongly Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>\\r\\n',\n",

       "    'review': '<p>I have been a bit of a Disney-phille my whole life. Disneyland has been a frequent destination vacation for me; and a lot of the classic Disney films were commonly viewed by VHS tape in my childhood. As I have grown I have grown to recognize the rather amazing story in how Walt Disney was able to build arguably&nbsp;<em>the&nbsp;</em>entertainment empire of the world from a small studio making short cartoons; and how that empire has evolved in the years since his passing. The selection of Minifigures&nbsp;Lego has produced has given us a slice at that history, from Disney&#39;s roots as small studio; to their reinvention&nbsp;in the 1990&#39;s; to their modern works shared with subsidiary studios such as Pixar.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With my admiration for Disney; this is the first CMF series I have finally made an effort in collecting in its entirety. Amassing&nbsp;the collection required frequently checking small town Wal-Marts, and other&nbsp;stores in my local area; and even acquiring a few of the figures at Downtown Disney in Anaheim outside the gates of Disneyland itself. I owe my collection to the valuable help and patience of my parents and sister; who helped buy a few figures and even stood in stores with me feeling the polybags with me (my sister is fully responsible for feeling the bags for my Captain Hook and Aladdin figures). It has been quite a journey to amass this collection!&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Since CMF lines are hardly traditional Lego sets, this review will focus solely on each unique minifig. I will try and place figures in a rough chronology of the release of their original source material; as I feel the collection is best viewed as a slice of Disney&#39;s history.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Minifigures</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Mickey Mouse</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks&nbsp;for the film&nbsp;<em>Plane Crazy,&nbsp;</em>Mickey debuted publicly alongside Minnie Mouse in the film&nbsp;<em>Steamboat Willie</em>, one of the earliest films to use sound. The Lego version of Mickey is based on his &quot;standard&quot; appearance in red shorts with yellow shoes. Unfortunately this is one of Mickey&#39;s most bland outfits, and that diminishes the appeal of the Lego version. Despite its standard looks, the figure does feature a new molded head (shared with Minnie) and dual molded legs. Ultimately I am satisfied to have this figure, although it is likely its value will increase using the head with different outfits to represent Mickey&#39;s different guises over the years.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Minnie Mouse</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Minnie fares far better than her boyfriend of 87 years. Her pink dress is similar to Mickey in the sense it is a &quot;standard&quot; look for her in the modern era. However the figure is full of detail, the new skirt piece being a highlight. Minnie also uses dual molded arms and legs which greatly enhance the figure. A pink bow attaches to the head to finish the figure.&nbsp;Like Mickey though, she comes with no additional accessories.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Donald Duck</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Created in 1934, Donald is the famed short tempered duck of Disney&#39;s animated short films. He is an interesting figure, and is dressed in his &quot;standard&quot; sailor outfit. The head is a new mold shared with Daisy; and I have noticed is already appearing in a lot of MOCs in the Lego fan community.&nbsp;The hat is unique, and connects to Donald via a peg connector. The tail piece is a soft rubber, and the legs are dual molded. Donald is a great figure, and is fun to have.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Daisy Duck</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Daisy is a bit more of a bland Lego figure than Donald; as the muted pink colors used on her don&#39;t stand out as much as Donald&#39;s bright blue colors. She still uses dual molded legs and arm, and comes with the same rubber tail piece as Donald. Her bow is the same mold used for Minnie&#39;s; but lacks the complex printing. Daisy was created in 1940, and represent the last of the figures from Disney&#39;s &quot;short cartoon&quot; era. After the release of&nbsp;<em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs </em>in 1937, Disney began an increased focus on theatrical films which will be the source of the rest of the Lego figures in this theme.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Alice</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Based on the character from the 1951 film based on Lewis Carrols&#39; writings; Alice was a figure I wasn&#39;t to excited for and was my last acquisition while collecting the line. However, once I had the figure in hand, I was surprised by how great it is. Alice comes with dual molded arms, and a skirt piece from the same mold as Minnie&#39;s. Alice&#39;s hair piece is new, and is rather smooth and &quot;cartoony.&quot; The best part of Alice is the addition of a cookie and glass bottle to represent the &quot;Drink Me&quot; and &quot;Eat Me&quot; concoctions from the film. Alice was a figure that far surpassed my expectations.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The Cheshire Cat</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The first of three figures which use short legs, the Cheshire Cat is a unique figure. His headpiece is new, and his tail is the same formerly used for Rocket Racoon in the Guardians of The Galaxy line; but now in a new pink color. The short legs are a unique subject... I can&#39;t tell if the stripe on them is a high quality print, or a new example of Lego &quot;tri-molding&quot; a piece. The figure is impressive, but suffers from it&#39;s humanoid form since the Cheshire Cat is in the film a four legged creature, and loses part of its personality standing on two legs here in Lego form.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Peter Pan&nbsp;</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The hero from the 1953 film of the same name, Peter Pan originated as a stage character that would gain additional fame in Disney&#39;s film. The figure is accurate; and has a new hair/hat mold, and dual molded arms and legs. The one strange part is the dual knifes that come with the figure... which are molded in a strange pearl gold which differs from the packaging&#39;s (and film accurate)&nbsp;silver color. It is also strange to see him wielding two knifes; although this is a necessity due to the sprue molded nature of the Lego piece. This figure is fun; and I can&#39;t help but wonder how he would look with the recently released Big Ben set...</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Captain Hook</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The antagonist from&nbsp;<em>Peter Pan</em>; Captain Hook&#39;s outlandish behavior in the animated film is iconic, and I am glad that Lego has succeeded in capturing his character! His face is comically villainous, and his hat/hair piece is a wonderful mold. One of my favorite figures in this wave.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Maleficent&nbsp;</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The villain from the 1959 film&nbsp;<em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, it is strange that she is included in the series; but not any other characters from the film. Still the figure is a wonderful sight, with two cape pieces to build her robes, a golden staff, and a hard rubber hat piece that gives the figure uniquely villainous horns. This is the last figure representing the classic Disney film era. Walt Disney would die in 1966 from complications with lung cancer, and for the following decades The Walt Disney Company would wander a bit aimlessly. Things began to slowly change first with the release of the 1988 film&nbsp;<em>Who Framed Rodger Rabbit&nbsp;</em>which was co-produced with Amblin Productions; but the definitive return to form for Disney would occur with the film represented by the next to figures in the Lego series...</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Ariel</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The 1989 film&nbsp;<em>The Little Mermaid</em>&nbsp;was a resounding success, and fully launched Disney animated films back into the public spotlight. The success of the film would inspire future Disney films, an effect that is seen in almost all the following films represented by the rest of the Lego figures in this series. Ariel is a unique figure with her mermaid tail which has been previously seen in other CMF lines, but is now seen in unique colors and prints for Ariel. Areil&#39;s hair piece is a spot on representation of her animated hair, and looks wonderful. She comes with a clam with a gem, a small accessory which isn&#39;t entirely needed but is fun to have.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Ursula</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One of the most unique figures produced in this line, Ursula comes with a new molded body piece to represent her octopus form. A new hair piece rounds out the look of the figure. Ursula is one of the least poseable figures in the line, but her unique looks help cement this as a favorite figure of mine.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Aladdin&nbsp;</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The 1992 film <em>Aladdin</em>&nbsp;continued Disney&#39;s wave of hits in the early 1990&#39;s. The figure here is a great rendition of the figure; and many Lego fans will enjoy having new pieces in a rarely used skin tone in the Lego palette. My only critique is the inclusion of the same lamp included in the Genie, missing out on the opportunity to include Abu in Lego form. Aladdin is still a great figure, and a great addition to the CMF lineup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Genie</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Also from the film&nbsp;<em>Aladdin,&nbsp;</em>Genie was voiced by the late Robin Williams; whose rather recent passing makes this figure feel like a very fitting part of the lineup. The figure uses a tail piece used in previous CMF Genies, and also includes the same lamp that comes with Aladdin. The head piece is a new mold, and comes with a unique hair piece that connects via a peg. A great figure for the line.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Buzz Lightyear</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With the success of <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, and later <em> Beauty and the Beast,&nbsp;Aladdin,</em> and <em>The Lion King</em>,&nbsp;animated films spiked in popularity. Even while Disney was beginning to churn out hit after hit, interest was sparked in a new form of animation using computer generated images. Pixar a computer animated division of George Lucas&#39;s Lucasfilm studios, until it was spun off.&nbsp;Ed Catmull&nbsp;(of my alma mater) headed Pixar as a new independent company in 1986, when Steve Jobs bought the firm from George Lucas. Under Steve Job&#39;s ownership, Catmull&#39;s&nbsp;leadership, and (the now controversial) John&nbsp;Lasseter&#39;s creative lead, the firm produced the first theatrical length animated film&nbsp;<em>Toy Story</em>&nbsp;which deputed in 1994 and was distributed by Disney.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Buzz has appeared before in Lego form, in the 2010 Toy Story Theme, but his new minifigure shows several updates. His molded head has been replaced by a standard minifigure head.His body features new leg and arm prints, even including the &quot;laser&quot; on his right arm. The torso print is bland, but complements his bulky space suit armor. His visor is always half open, a feature which disappointed my mother when she tried to &quot;close it&quot; not knowing about the piece&#39;s limits. Still it would be difficult to build a closing visor in Lego at this scale, so it is likely this is now th definitive version of Buzz Lightyear for the time being.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Little Green Man</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Arguably the most controversial figure in this series, many FOL&#39;s have criticized it for featuring few changes from the previous 2010 version. This is my first version of this character, so I am not complaining; however other than updated printing there is not anything new in this figure. This might be a pass for those who own the 2010 Toy Story Sets.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Stitch</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As CGI began to dominate the animation industry; Disney began producing fewer films in classic hand drawn animation.&nbsp;<em>Lilo and Stitch&nbsp;</em>was one of the last hits of the era, being released in 2002. Stitch would become one of Disney&#39;s biggest icons, his merchandise including everything from plush animals to pins depicting Stitch dressed in the guise of Star War&#39;s Emperor Palpatine. It is no surprise that this hit character is included in this CMF line. His head piece is a unique and highly accurate mold, and the look of the figure looks like his &quot;Earth Dog&quot; look, representing the parts in the film were he is hiding his second set of arms and his alien spikes. However the use of short legs limits the ability to pose the figure and recreate the four legged guise used in a large part of the film.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Mr. Incredible (Bob Parr)</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The 2004 film&nbsp;<em>The Incredibles</em>&nbsp;was one of Pixar&#39;s last films made before being fully acquired by Disney in 2006. Mr. Incredible comes with dual molded legs and arms in Lego form, and a new hairpiece that shows balding. The red suit does look a bit plain in Lego form though. The figure comes with a new print on the classic 2x2 tile; that has a great super hero poster on it. One of my copies of this figure is the only printing error I have seen in my Disney CMF collection, a domino mask that is a bit &quot;smudged&quot; extending it higher than the correctly printed figure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Syndrome (Buddy Pine)</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The archenemy&nbsp;of Mr. Incredible, is highly detailed in Lego form with dual molded legs and arms, and Lego and arm printing. His blue eyes are a bit strange for a Lego figure, but complement the sinister look of the figure. His 2x2 tile is printed with controls for the Omnidroid, and will surely appear in many sci-fi&nbsp;MOCs yet to come. His hair piece is new, and he is a great looking figure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Overall opinion</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I have never before felt the desire to collect a CMF line like I did with this one, and having them all in hand I am rather impressed. Despite some weaker figures, the final collection shines. This is an awesome collectible figure line; and I am hoping Lego does a second wave, since Disney has many&nbsp;characters that could translate well into Lego form! This is definitely a must buy series.</p>\\r\\n',\n",

       "    'review': '<p><strong>-STITCH-</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A nice beloved character to be lucky to get from the first packs of bags, for my case I got 3 of him. Having a&nbsp;head mould and simple printing with a nice touch of that fur on the chest.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Though I sadden that he wasn&#39;t paired&nbsp;with Lilo, which is strange to why as he and&nbsp;Maleficent are the only two that aren&#39;t paired.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>-MALEFICENT-</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A nicely&nbsp;accurate figure, though a find it doesn&#39;t need to cape aside the collar part but was nice to get. The headwear is a very cool&nbsp;looking piece and could be reuse outside the character for demon horns.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>-ALIEN &amp; BUZZ LIGHTYEAR-</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Return of Buzz Lightyear with more detail printing and a minifigure head rather than the <a href=\"https://brickset.com/minifigs/toy004/buzz-lightyear\">head mould</a> we got in 2010, we did get return of the bodywear pieces in the exact same prints. In which the Alien head mould have the same thing of reusing&nbsp;the same print.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A bit sad that Woody isn&#39;t in it to have more detail printing for his arm and legs, though you can do many things with&nbsp;multiple aliens and can change the&nbsp;duplicate Buzz head&nbsp;to make Star Command.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>However, good thing Woody wasn&#39;t in it as year later we got <a href=\"https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Toy-Story/subtheme-Toy-Story-4\">Toy Story 4 sets</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>-ALADDIN AND GENIE-</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A great pair choice with simple design and nice mould headwear, though it expected for them to be reused again in the future for the same characters in minidoll form.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The odd thing about the two is both of them having a&nbsp;Genie Lamp, it would be great to get Abu from one of them.&nbsp;Who know when we&#39;re getting that monkey.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>-ALICE AND CHESHIRE CAT-</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The first time we&#39;re getting&nbsp;Alice in Wonderland stuff, and in minifigure form first rather than minidoll.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alice coming off as very doll like, could imagine the figure actually being used as a doll in a large room model. The&nbsp;accessories bring us new bottle and cookie with nice printing, could imagine the bottle being used for something else.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Cheshire Cat have nice moulded head that holds that creepy look. It&#39;s the first time we got the tail printed, with the&nbsp;tail is design could bring us more different kind of printing for this piece. The rest of the body I could see being used for PJs.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>-DAISY, DONALD, MINNIE &amp; MICKEY-</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Outside from Goody, we got all of Mickey and his friends in their iconic look, outside from Donald who been reused in the <a href=\"https://brickset.com/sets/71040-1/Disney-Castle\">Disney Castle</a>&nbsp;(if he was in a very cheaper set, I would have been very annoyed).&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>They all have head moulds we would keep seeing again in the future with a pin hold on the top of their head to attach stuff into. Having this as the character of a hat/bow.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While we see these characters again, I&#39;m glade that they keep the outfit exclusive.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>-MR. INCREDIBLE &amp; SYNDROME-</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sadly for this, Mr. Incredible was reused again years later that I wish they could try to keep this exclusive proof&nbsp;and went with his old costume from his Glory Days. But instead we got that costume in a printing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Syndrome is a lot better compared with the detail on the arms and nice silver on the shoes. I love the hair and like with Kai&#39;s hair I wish they could be reused for some sort of fire.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>-PETER PAN &amp; CAPTAIN HOOK-</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Even though it shows Peter having silver dagger, they are actually gold, must have been change in the last second after already making all the official pictures.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Outside that the two have great design, Captain Hook having that big headwear that would be impossible not to detect in the blind bag.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We got&nbsp;tinkerbell in the Disney Castle set, but I wish Peter could have a statue of her, as this is also the first Peter Pan aside from the <a href=\"https://brickset.com/sets/10526-1/Peter-Pan-s-Visit\">Duplo set.</a></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>-ARIEL AND URSULA-</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The two bring us more of those fish legs for any demi minifigures, wishing that Ursula along with <a href=\"https://brickset.com/sets/71024-13/Hades\">Hades from series 2</a> legs could make a return in some way.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The printing and accessory are given are very nice, along with accrete hair. Even though Ariel&#39;s hair look fake looking, probably why they kept using the one from the minidoll for her and this hair remain CMF exclusive.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Overall</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Outside of Mr. Incredible, this is a fine selection for the first series of Disney CMF, with many of the iconic characters.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>However, aside from Mickey and Friends, I wish the Disney CMF was more focus on turning the Minidolls into Minifigures. Rather than character that we could see in sets as minifigures as we see with <a href=\"https://brickset.com/sets/subtheme-Incredibles-2\">Incredibles</a> and Toy Story.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I very much recommend collecting these if you&#39;re a fan of Disney overall but suggest getting the sets variants of the minifigure character if they are cheaper than the CMF.</p>\\r\\n',\n",

       "    'review': '<p>Ever since I visited the grand Neuschwanstein Castle, I have found the Romanesque-revival palaces to be very interesting. So it is not surprising that when LEGO created&nbsp;a set based on Disney&#39;s Cinderella&#39;s Castle (which takes inspiration indirectly from Neuschwanstein Castle), I was very excited for its release. I knew that a fairytale castle could never fully be replicated in a smaller set (&lt;$200), so I was even more pleased when the Disney Castle turned out to be a large, $350 set.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I must admit, I am not a huge Disney fan, I have never been to Disney World (or Land) and I have only seen a few of the movies referenced by this set,&nbsp;so my comments on accuracy to the castle&nbsp;are confined to the pictures I have found on the internet.&nbsp;With that in mind, this review will look at the Cinderella&#39;s Castle from the view of a LEGO&nbsp;fan&nbsp;who happens to really enjoy the style of architecture that the castle is built in.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The box is appropriately gorgeous, with the castle easily distinguishable from the nighttime background due to the castle&#39;s prominent use of light bluish&nbsp;grey, tan, and white. Fireworks surround the castle recreating the fireworks show that happens every night at Disney World. The box itself is similar in size to the box for the&nbsp;Ghostbusters&#39; Firehouse, and about 2/3 the size of the Death Star box. The sides are mostly blank with a small inset showing the same image as the front of the box and the five included minifigures are displayed on the top. As expected, the back of the box showcases the back of the castle in detail with other insets for showing the minifigures interacting with the scenes contained within the castle.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Inside the box is a second, smaller&nbsp;box which holds about half of the bags for the set. The box seems to have been added more for structure than for organization as the bags contained within were in no discernable order, with some of the same numbers being both inside and outside of the smaller box. The instructions are a single 492 page perfect-bound booklet that comes wrapped in its own bag (no cardboard). For larger sections of the model where it might be difficult to find the added pieces, the pieces are outlined in red. I only had a slight trouble differentiating between tan and dark tan for one step, but otherwise the instructions are very clear and easy to understand.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Parts</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As&nbsp;expected, this set has a large and broad collection of white, tan, and light bluish grey elements. In addition, the castle contains a large amount of&nbsp;slopes and cones&nbsp;in dark blue; several of which are new in that color. The quantity of parts is very substantial because there is a good variety of larger and smaller elements which allows the castle to reach a substantial height, but still maintain excellent detailing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While this set contains a large amount of elements (4080 to be exact), only a smaller portion of the set is basic bricks. This makes this castle an excellent parts pack for people looking to add details to a castle or people who would like to build tall towers, but a poor set to start with to try and make a more traditional, sprawling castle. For a builder that already has a number of more basic bricks in his/her collection, this set contains a number of exciting newer elements in a variety of colors.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are 13 elements in new colors:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>26 of <a href=\"http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=3685&amp;in=S\">Dark Blue&nbsp;Slope 75 2 x 2 x 3 Double Convex</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li>25 of <a href=\"http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=87620&amp;in=S\">Tan&nbsp;Brick, Modified Facet 2 x 2</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li>25 of <a href=\"http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=3684c&amp;in=S\">Dark Blue&nbsp;Slope 75 2 x 2 x 3 -

However, given the price of the set, the sticker sheet is minimal. The sheet contains 17 stickers printed on a metallic backing. 3 are used for the shields, one for Disney&#39;s crest (on a White 2 x 2 Tile) above the gateway, one for the Magic Mirror, and 6 of each type of brick detailing. All of the stickers seem to be of good quality&nbsp;and are not likely to peel over time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Minifigures</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>All of the five included minifigures are superbly detailed. In fact, some of the some of the minifigures (Minnie Mouse) have some of the most detail that I have seen on a minifigure. My thoughts on each of the minifigures are shown below in the order that they appear in the build:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Mickey Mouse looks almost identical to the costume in the park;&nbsp;the minifgure has his large yellow boy tie, his white vest, red pants with white polka dots, black shoes, and black jacket. The minifigure even includes a black pinstripe running down the side of the red legs and a new cloth element to represent his coat-tails. While the head may be the same as the Disney Minifigures version, it still is a great sculpt that accurately represents the head of Mickey Mouse. Strangely enough, Mickey does not have any back printing, although given the look of his suit jacket, it is unlikely that there would be much detail to add.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Minnie Mouse is one of the most detailed minifigures that I have ever seen. the minifigure has here park accurate red dress with white polka dots, red bow with white polka dots, and even yellow shoes printed on her dual moulded legs. Her arms are dual moulded in red and black to get the short sleeves of the dress and have a printed white cuff line. Minnie&#39;s head sculpt is accurate too with great printed eyelashes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Donald Duck is the exact same minifigure as the one in the Disney Minifigures; however, this does not decrease the quality of the minifigure. The minifigure contains all of the necessary details including yellow bands on his shirt sleeves, dual moulded legs in white and bright light orange, a special duck-tail element,&nbsp;and a great head sculpt with separate hat. His head sculpt is detailed enough to even include a pink tongue inside his mouth!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Daisy Duck is another very detailed minifigure with medium purple bow, pink shirt with medium purple frills, and dual moulded legs in white&nbsp;and bright light orange similar to Donald Duck, only Daisy has medium purple shoes printed onto the minifigure&#39;s feet. From my bit of research, the medium purple shoes should probably have been printed in pink instead as most versions&nbsp;of Daisy Duck in the park&nbsp;seem to have pink shoes. Aside from the shoes, Daisy Duck is about as accurate as one could get given minifigure proportions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Tinker Bell&nbsp;is the final minifigure in the set. Her inclusion most likely references her part in opening the fireworks show at Disney World&nbsp;by flying across the castle. As a minifigure Tinker Bell&nbsp;accurately represents the character&#39;s look with blond hair tied up in a bun, light blue fairy wings, and a lime green dress. Her legs have lime green shoes printed on the front of the toes only to make the shoes seem closer to the light slippers that Tinker Bell wears than the heavy shoes that Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck wear. A wand is included for her as she holds one in the fireworks show at Disney World.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Some might complain that five minifigures in a $350 set seem a bit low, but given the scaling of the castle and the excellent quality of the included five minifigures, five seems just about right. One benefit of less minifigures is that&nbsp;more of the set&#39;s budget could be put into making the castle larger and more grand, which was certainly appreciated me. The exclusion of Cinderella from the minifigure line is certainly interesting considering that this is a recreation of her castle; however, her minidoll has already appeared several times in Disney Princess sets, so I expect that it was intended that you could get her from any of those sets instead. Plus, seeing as this set is based on the park, the included minifigures make complete sense as they are the&nbsp;most notable costumed characters from the Disney World.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>The build</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Disney Castle is an enjoyable build the entire way through despite some repetition. It took me a little over 10 hours at a leisurely pace&nbsp;to complete the set, but I imagine if less time was used adjusting&nbsp;parts to make sure the LEGO logos were all facing the same way it could be completed in about 7-8 hours. Marco Bessa put a lot of work into making sure that the castle had details from every angle.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Several interesting techniques are used in the creation of the angled subset tiled floor of the ballroom, the white decorative elements below the windows of each of the turrets, the windows on each of the three round turrets, and the railings of the main tower. Some details that are built into the castle are really only seen while building the castle like the four arches around the inside of the ballroom which each have a smaller light bluish grey arch and two taller tan half-arches that create a beautiful decorative arch.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As expected with a large castle, the set does have some repetitive steps; however, these builds are kept small and so infrequently that the build never becomes tedious.The build is divided into 14 sections/bags and three main sections of the castle (the base with the walls and gatehouse, the main tan building, and the final three floors of the tall spire. Each bag contains little details that make it so that no bag has a boring build.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Bag 1 builds the base of the castle and includes the small scene devoted to the Princess and the Frog. The next bag contains Mickey Mouse, the first minifigure, and builds the six elaborate pillars of the ballroom. Bag 3 starts build of the gatehouse and Bag 4 contains the elements needed to finish off the interior of the ballroom. This bag also includes the archery range from Brave and a grandfather clock that ties into Cinderella.The two knight statues (which are full minifigures)&nbsp;are included in Bag 4 as well. Bag 5 contains Minnie Mouse and builds the left wall of the castle, with Bag 6 building the right wall of the castle. Bag 6 also builds the Flying Carpet and Lamp from Aladdin. The next bag finally finishes off the gatehouse. Bag 8 introduces Donald Duck and starts the work on the upper portions of the left turret with Bag 9 finishing off the turrets.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Bag 10 begins work on the main tan tower and contains Daisy Duck. This bag also includes references to Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;(Lumiere&nbsp;and the rose in the glass jar) as well as the Little Mermaid (the kitchen) and Cinderella (the pumpkin). The next bag continues to build up the tower including references to Fantasia (mops, buckets, and wizard hat) and Sleeping Beauty (spinning wheel).Bag 12 finishes up the main tan tower with the Walt Disney Dream Suite and the base of the tall spire. This bag also includes a glass slipper for Cinderella and the Once Upon a Time printed&nbsp;book.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Bag 13 contains Tinker Bell, the final minifigure, and builds most of the tall turret excluding the gold spire. This bag references Tangled with&nbsp;a treasure chest filled with&nbsp;a hair brush, scissors, and a black lock of hair as well as Snow White with the Magic Mirror and the Poisoned Apple. Bag 14 completes the tower as well as the castle&nbsp;by adding the gold spire.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>The completed model</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As I build the model, I realized that the Disney Castle would be very tall, even with that knowledge, I was still surprised by just how tall the completed model was. The castle easily dwarfs all my other tall sets by a large margin. The clever choice of tan for walls and white for detains on the main part of the castle allow the extravagant detailing to easily be seen and keeps it from being drowned out in a sea of white. The dark blue roofs complement nicely with the white, tan and light bluish grey and give the castle a royal feeling.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Unlike many models, this set looks great from almost every angle and could even be displayed with just the interior facing forward (although the exterior is still more impressive). Details are everywhere on the castle, including the sides, which makes the model feel more like a complete castle even though it is really only&nbsp;the front half of the real-life castle.&nbsp;Some especially impressive details include the white 1 x 2 plates and 1 x 1 tiles that form the supports for all of the battlements and walkways along with the strategic use of brick textured&nbsp;bricks only on the tops to accentuate the upper parts of each wall. The use of the six&nbsp;Light Bluish Gray&nbsp;Wedge 16 x 4 Triple Curved pieces around the three turrets combine with the rounded panels to create a gentle tapering shape which suits the fairytale feel of the castle.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This castle walks a fine line between minifigure scale details and a scaled model. Parts of the castle such as the steps to the entrance and the interiors are scaled to minifigures while the upper portions of the exterior are obviously not minifigure scale. Yet, even with two distinct scales converging in the same model, the finished castle does not feel like it compromised the look of the&nbsp;interior or the exterior to stay within scales. The tiny&nbsp;windows of the turrets and covered walkways look excellent and are far enough removed from any minifigure elements that the scale difference is not as obvious.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The large pieces used in creation of the main tower and in the lower walls of the castle do not reduce the detail of the castle, but instead provide some necessary contrast to the ornate details of the rest of the castle. Without those sections, the human eye would be unable to focus on any part of the set for very long.&nbsp;The brickwork stickers help to add detail on some of the larger panels, but even without them, the castle would still look just as impressive. It is also worth noting that the stickers in this set are very easy to apply. The stickers either filled entire surfaces (ex.&nbsp;the shields)&nbsp;or were forgiving on placement (ex. the&nbsp;brickwork).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Overall opinion</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As is probably obvious from my glowing review of this set, I hugely recommend this set Disney and castle fans alike. With Nexo Knights replacing traditional castle sets for the time being, this set should help tide castle fans over to the next grand castle set. In fact, I am dubious if a more ornate castle set could&nbsp;be produced for the next long while.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is easily worth the $350 entry tag, as this castle is quite large and easily surpasses the usual size cutoff for in this price range. I would even argue that this set could still be a great seller at the higher price of $400 (but there might be more people complaining about how few minifigures are in this set).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With an excellent range of new, rare, and useful parts, five superbly detailed minifigures, a build that is never boring, and an awe-inspiring final model, The Disney Castle is one set I would not pass up.</p>\\r\\n',\n",

       "    'review': '<p>This set is full of surprise and was probably the best build I&#39;ve done. There was always something to look forward to building whether it be a little detail hinting to a Disney movie to just getting to milestones in the build such as that next tower or that next wall. &nbsp;I have worked with a great Youtuber&nbsp;while building this and you can find a time lapse of my build here with a review to come later this week on this same channel.&nbsp;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uEStW4CmwLA</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The box is quite interesting for this set as bags 1 3 5 9 12 and 13 are found inside a smaller box within the sets main box. The smaller box inside here is about half the size of the main box. &nbsp;The instructions are definitely much different from those of other expert sets such as the modular buildings. The set has one extremely large instruction booklet with approximately 850 steps in it. The book itself if very sturdy and you don&#39;t have to worry about destroying the instruction booklet as you build.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Parts</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are a lot of great new parts made just for this set that I am very happy with. If I had to guess I would say about 30 new pieces whether they are brand new or existing pieces in a new color. The only complaint I have about the parts is I wish there were a few more printed parts so I did not have to mess with stickers too much but with how many new pieces there were can&#39;t complain about 20 stickers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Minifigures</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Minifigures are great for this set representing the theme parks castle but wish there were a few different ones. I wish we did have a Cinderella to go with her castle and also wish there was a variation between Donald from the minifigures series and the one found in this set. Other than that good to have 4 brand new Disney figures commonly found in the theme parks that go with the set nicely and also I&#39;ve heard some criticism about Tinker Bell and trust me, she looks better in person.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>The build</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The build does not take that long and for anyone that has built any other expert set should take no more than 7-8 hours. &nbsp;It took me about 6 and a half hours to complete and it was probably my favorite build. The build is so much fun because of all the detail that exists within the set. It is so awesome to be building and you go to add something that doesn&#39;t really seem to fit then you are like oh I know what movie that&#39;s from. Also finding all the different pieces that are new is nice and just keeps you waiting to see what&#39;s in the next bag.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>The completed model</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The completed model is huge and I had trouble finding somewhere to display it. It was so difficult to display because I had to chose between showing the front or back of the castle. While the front of the castle is the reason the people buy this set the back of the castle has so much detail and relates to so many Disney movies I was torn between the two. In the end my Lego side trumped my Disney side and I decided to display the front of the castle with the Disney minifigure series. &nbsp;There are 10 different movies represented within the build and all are shown so well. &nbsp;One thing I&#39;m not a huge fan of with the model is the &quot;fireworks&quot; launcher but overall helps the playability factor of the set.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Overall opinion</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Overall defiantly one of my favorite sets to build and one of the best looking sets I own. I can only hope they will include more sets based on the Disney parks in the future as I am sure this set will do very well and do well for a long time to come.

       "    'review': '<p>Being a Lego fan and Disney fan, I knew had to buy it when I&nbsp;first saw it. So on the Saturday before Black Friday with double VIP points and the snow globe it bought it. Upon receiving the package and opening the box, I noticed that a bag a had opened during shipping, but luckily no pieces were missing.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The build began with a technic frame and 16x16&nbsp;plates. The build&nbsp;continues&nbsp;by building up the front door and surrounding parts. Then the side walls are attached after being assembled in a sub-build.&nbsp;The interior details are finished&nbsp;and then the spires are built on the lower section of the build. The spire builds are very repetitive and to my only complaint with the build.&nbsp;This lower, gray part of the castle is now finished and is set aside for the rest of the build. Next the tan part in back is built and will eventually be attached with 2x2 jumper plates similar to the modular buildings. &nbsp;The build continues by first building up the structure and then adding the interior&nbsp;details. Many of the classic Disney movies are referenced in the interior rooms. Finally, the tallest spire is built&nbsp;and attached also by 2x2 jumper plates. The finished castle is a wonderful sight and the build took me about 8 hours over 3 days.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One of my favorite things about the castle is its similarity to the real thing. The exterior is very realistic. Another part that I enjoy is the interior references to the Disney movies. All of the interiors represent thier movies very well.&nbsp;The minifigures are also great renditions of the characters they represent in real life and it is exciting that they are exclusive to this set.&nbsp;I don&#39;t know what else to highlight here as most of the castle is amazing.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I feel the worst thing about this castle is the amount of stickers used. I understand the use of the stone stickers along the exterior and the mirror sticker, but I feel all of the shields and&nbsp;2x2 tile, should have been printed. Another thing that is disappointing to me is the lack of minifigures. The ones that were included were great, but a few more would have been nice and I would have happily paid and extra $50 to get Cinderella, Merida (from <em>Brave</em>), Sleeping Beauty, and others from the movies referenced. The last complaint I have is the repetitiveness of the build, but there is not much you can do about it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I feel this set is a great representation of the Disney&nbsp;Castle, and for the money is a great value.</p>\\r\\n',\n",

       "    'review': '<p>I should start by admitting that I love 1) castles, 2) Disney World, and 3) Lego, so a Lego Disney Castle set pushes multiple big buttons for me just by existing! I did have very high expectations for this set though (especially given the pricetag), and can honestly say that they were EXCEEDED. Truly remarkable!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>The Build</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The bags are separated into 14 numbered sets, containing from 1-3 bags each. This makes for a very streamlined and efficient build. I did some minimal sorting at the beginning of each step, but really only because I like to.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Interestingly, the minifigs do not come first all at once as they do in most sets (in my experience at least). Instead, they are distributed one at a time throughout the build, beginning with Mickey in bag 2. I personally prefer this, since I always want to start putting some walls up right away. Obviously you can go in and fish out the minifig parts (or set them aside for later if you prefer), so this probably doesn&rsquo;t matter that much either way&hellip;, but I thought the change was potentially notable.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The base of the castle is built first, and it is exceptionally stable and sturdy! It consists of a matrix of technic squares and pins, sandwiched between two layers of plates. Sloping pieces at the edges attractively hide the inner contents of this strong 1-brick high base from view. The strength of the base is fantastic &ndash; you can in fact support the entire castle by the front steps alone with one hand (if your grip is strong enough) without it cracking! Compared to, for example, #4842 Hogwarts Castle (2010 version), whose fragile construction has made me curse in surprising ways so many times, the excellent engineering of this castle is much appreciated. The walls and towers of the castle itself are also very sturdy and well bonded together. There are many small decorative details that will be prone to getting accidentally knocked off or askew during play, but this hefty fellow is certainly not going to fall to pieces every time somebody sneezes like #4842.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The build is of course long, but not tedious at all. There is some symmetry to the castle, but lots of asymmetrical elements as well to keep things interesting. Some of the other large sets that I have built (e.g. #10214 Tower Bridge, and #10247 Ferris Wheel) have been so repetitious in parts that it actually felt like a bit of a slog &ndash; there were definitely times that I was just pushing through to get done, and not really enjoying the process (despite the fact that I generally love building with legos). Not so with the Disney Castle &ndash; the build was fantastically varied and a sheer delight to build! The only mildly tedious element I&rsquo;d say was building the little white crenelated decorations (there are several dozen of these), but they are interspersed throughout the build so it&rsquo;s not too bad. In general each step drew me onwards with fun new elements, and I found it hard to stop once I got going.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A variety of interesting building techniques are used throughout the castle: lots of SNOT, as well as offsetting and floating bricks on tiles to create interesting angles. The decorative elements, especially around the front entrance and on the towers, show some brilliantly creative use of pieces for lovely visual effects. Overall this castle is by far the most impressive Lego set I have personally built in terms of solid engineering and creative building design. The designer did an amazing job on many levels here! Often there seems to be a bit of tension between aesthetic considerations and structural ones, but here these principles have been executed harmoniously and at high levels!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>The Interior</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One of the things that I think was a brilliant design decision for this set is that although the exterior is modeled on a real building (the Cinderella Castle at the Magic Kingdom), the interior is a complete fantasy. And this fantasy surely resonates with many children (past and present) who have ever visited Walt Disney World &ndash; isn&rsquo;t it the wish of every child, on first entering the park, to go inside the castle and explore? We imagine it to be a maze of staircases and rooms, inhabited by numerous Disney princesses, heroes, and fantastic creatures. We long to run from room to room and discover its magical secrets. How disappointing when we learn (if we are allowed inside at all) that it contains nothing but a hair salon and an overpriced restaurant serving warmed up casserole! Fortunately, the Lego Disney Castle contains everything we wish the real one did &ndash; room after room filled with treasures from favorite Disney movies. I like that they chose to represent a variety of movies from different time periods &ndash; including older films like Fantasia and Snow White, as well as more recent ones like Brave and Tangled, and some in between.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In general I thought all the little interior decorations were fabulously done, with two small personal quibbles being 1) the bed and curtains in the bedroom completely obscure the window, which seems weird, and 2) Merida&rsquo;s archery range area is sandwiched on a narrow landing between two layers of towers and is extremely difficult to access for play (my daughter commented on this right away).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Minifigures</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The only major-ish criticism I have, which has been mentioned by pretty much every reviewer, is the quantity and choice of minifigures. First of all, most sets in this size/price range include 2-3 times the number of minifigures (for comparison, #10247 Ferris Wheel has 10, #70751 Temple of Airjitzu has 13, #10217 Diagon Alley has 12, #75059 Sandcrawler has 14). The Disney Castle has a piddly 5. Maybe they were marketing it solely to adults (a mistake, I&rsquo;d say) and figured (wrongly, I&rsquo;d say) that adults aren&rsquo;t interested in minifigs? 10-15 would have been a more appropriate number for a set of this size/nature.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Secondly, the particular selection of minfigs included is a bit disappointing. Mickey and Minnie are musts, of course, and Tinkerbelle is a nice touch, but the lack of a Cinderella fig (since it *is* Cinderella&rsquo;s Castle, after all) and her prince, or really any princesses and princes, seems really odd and limits playability. Especially if you&rsquo;re only going to have 5 figs, Donald and Daisy could have been swapped out for something more interesting. At least one exclusive prince/princess duo should have been included, and a villain or two would have been awesome! Some pets/animals would also seem appropriate (Cinderella&rsquo;s mice/birds/dogs come to mind). All the little rooms alluding to various Disney movies are so cute - an assortment of figures to go with some (or all) of these really would have made sense.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That being said, it&rsquo;s not terribly difficult to supplement the minifigs by purchasing more on the side (obviously at additional cost to yourself&hellip;). We supplemented with #10729 Cinderella&rsquo;s Carriage, which includes Cinderella, Prince Charming, and a small but cute little carriage. My daughter also happened to already have #41052 Ariel&rsquo;s Magic Kiss (Ariel &amp; Prince Eric), and #30116 Rapunzel&rsquo;s Market Visit (a polybag with Rapunzel). We had also picked up a few of the Disney Collection figures and happened to get the Genie, Maleficent, and Ursula &ndash; all relevant additions to the playset. There are several other small Disney sets featuring various characters that are available as well. (Hm, maybe &ldquo;encouraging&rdquo; you to buy more like this was the secret agenda here&hellip;?) Some of these will obviously be miniDOLLS rather than figs, but if you and/or your child are not too puritanical about this sort of thing (we are not), then you have plenty of options.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Playability</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In addition to being a show-stopping display piece (from both front and back, by the way), this castle would be the dollhouse of many children&rsquo;s dreams. My 10 (going on 11) year old daughter has been chomping at the bit for me to get it finished, and started playing with it even as it was a half-built work in progress. Again I do think adding at least a handful of minifigs/dolls from your own child&rsquo;s favorite Disney characters is almost essential for full playability though.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Value</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I was able to purchase the castle with double VIP points, and also got a nice promotional item that I really wanted, which took the sting out *somewhat*, but obviously it&rsquo;s still a very pricey set. I have not seen it sold discounted as yet (do sets of this type ever go on sale&hellip;?). However, I&rsquo;d say even at full price it represents a fair value (relative to other LEGO sets): 1) the price per piece is actually quite decent, especially considering that it&rsquo;s a licensed set, 2) the pieces included are not just little piddly 1x1s &ndash; there are a large number of hefty, interesting pieces that would be useful for any number of builds, and 3) it represents outstanding creativity, beauty, and playability value. Compare for example #10214 Tower Bridge, which has slightly more pieces but a significantly lower price: the Bridge is mostly 1x plates and other tiny pieces, mostly in tan, includes 0 minifigs, and has little to no playability. The Disney Castle involves a whole heck-load of ABS, quite a bit of it in gorgey Earth Blue and various interesting slopes, etc. If an item in this price/size class is in the budget for you, I&rsquo;d say this one is actually the most attractive value proposition of its class available currently, obviously if the theme has appeal for you.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Overall</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Stunning beauty and impressive size. Brilliant, strong, creative design. Fabulous interior and exterior details. Fun, imaginative play opportunities. Certainly the most incredible Lego set I have personally encountered. I really hope TLG produces more sets at this level!</p>\\r\\n',\n",

       "    'review': '<p>Having been fortunate enough to have visited Disney World a few times, I ordered this set as soon as I heard about it, and am very glad I did. &nbsp;The model is based squarely on Cinderella&#39;s castle from the heart of the Magic Kingdom theme park and LEGO have done an incredible job of coming up with something reasonably accurate, bearing in mind the scale used.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The box even has photographs depicting the completed model outside the real castle, so you can compare the two. &nbsp;Although some of the colouring isn&#39;t quite right, considering the limitations the designers had to work with, they have done a remarkable job.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Taking into account the piece count and the price, the Disney Castle comes in a large and attractive blue box. &nbsp;Inside, there are a number of bags, some of which are housed in a secondary white box, plus the instruction manual. &nbsp;A bit of sorting is required here, as the bags are numbered and that&#39;s it, so getting them in order is useful. &nbsp;I was disappointed that the packaging was so basic. &nbsp;My previous experience of a large LEGO build, the original <em>Star Wars</em> Death Star, consisted of numbered internal boxes and a ring-bound manual. &nbsp;That isn&#39;t featured here and as a result the box bulges a little with so many bags jostling for space. &nbsp;Overall you could see some cost-cutting in the packaging which was a shame at a premium price point.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Anyway, the build itself is magnificent and every bit as good as the finished model. &nbsp;I spread the build over a number of days and you are talking about several hours in total, but that is part of the attraction in a set like this, for me at least. &nbsp;The base is a whole lot of grey but thankfully broken up by a stunning mosaic floor in the middle. &nbsp;Once the base is complete, it&#39;s all about walls and the fantastic themed rooms inside the castle.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Although LEGO have obviously stuck with the strict castle design on the outside, imagination has run riot inside. &nbsp;A number of Disney movies are referenced:&nbsp;a bow and arrow plus target from <em>Brave</em>, the magic carpet from <em>Aladdin</em>, Cinderella&#39;s glass slipper, Snow White&#39;s mirror, hair brushes and so on from <em>Tangled</em>, Mickey&#39;s magician&#39;s hat and a mop from <em>Fantasia</em>&nbsp;plus much more. &nbsp;There are even frogs outside the castle, presumably representing <em>The Princess and the Frog</em>. &nbsp;It&#39;s fantastic, a lot of fun to build and then play around with when completed.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The castle&nbsp;is modular in as much as the upper floors can be detached as their own unit very easily in order to better access different aspects of the model. &nbsp;There are a few good play features, and in the latter stages you find yourself suddenly putting together what seems to be a set of guns, only to&nbsp;find they are &#39;firework&#39; launchers to go in the main tower. &nbsp;A nice touch to represent the real castle. &nbsp;Overall though, the castle has the feel of a display piece more than an out-and-out toy and in my house, it sits in our dining room as exactly that. &nbsp;Which isn&#39;t to say it doesn&#39;t get rotated around to show the inside and move the minifigs&nbsp;about, of course.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As with all that can be good, there is a but. &nbsp;And that is the aforementioned minifigures. &nbsp;There are just five, and that is staggeringly low for a set of this size. &nbsp;To reference so many Disney films and not include related minifigs&nbsp;is really surprising. &nbsp;You get Mickey and Minnie, which is fine, and Donald and Daisy, which seems a little odd but they&#39;re okay. &nbsp;Lastly, there is Tinkerbell, which is a great inclusion and a really nice figure. &nbsp;But a further five (Cinderella, Snow White, the Genie, Merida and so on) would have surely made a lot of sense.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It&#39;s not a deal breaker as the main attraction is the castle itself and it&#39;s magnificent. &nbsp;Standing at around 30&quot; tall it will catch anybody&#39;s eye. &nbsp;It&#39;s just a shame that with so much to see on the inside, there aren&#39;t more minifigs to adorn it. &nbsp;But don&#39;t let that put you off. &nbsp;If you love Disney and LEGO this set is the very definition of a no-brainer. &nbsp;If you can, treat yourself. &nbsp;You won&#39;t regret it.</p>\\r\\n',\n",

Seriously, it gets boring after your first two Minifigures in the series. But it is quality packaging and the checklist pamphlet is good, too.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Parts</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This one has some great parts. The hairpiece (shared with the Dino Tracker in Dark Brown) is the highlight, and the smoky genie tail returns, as well as the magic lamp.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>The build</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The build is very simple, especially since she has no neck accessories or skirts.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>The completed model</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>She&#39;s great. Close in approach to&nbsp;<em>I Dream of Jeannie</em>, she looks unique and distinctly different from the&nbsp;<em>Aladdin</em>-themed Genie of Series 6. Her hair looks good in blonde, and it is the perfect hairstyle for the character. It&#39;s tied-back hair with a very long, straight, ponytail down her back. It has a Pearl Gold hairband printed at the base of the ponytail on the top of her hair.&nbsp;Her face has Dark Tan eyebrows, &nbsp;silver lipstick and silver sparkles on it, and she has a playful winking expression. Her torso is Light Aqua, and she uses dual-molded arms to give her short sleeves of the same color. Her top is cut short, revealing her midriff, and it has tassels hanging on the bottom. She has back printing depicting the same on the other side. Her belly button is visible, and a thin curve of Medium Azure is printed on the bottom of her torso to blend the tail with it. Her tail is the same color as the Genie&#39;s, but it now has silver sparkles printed on the front of it, making it appear more magical. The shape of the tail means that the Genie Girl can be placed on her lamp, and the tip of the tail can align with the spout to make her appear to be coming out of it. Some complain about the clutch of her tail, but that&#39;s the way it was created, with less depth in the hole of the tail. I haven&#39;t had&nbsp;problems with it, though.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Overall opinion</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Phew! I wrote way too much!&nbsp;I like this Minifigure a lot! I would strongly recommend giving her a chance, because she&#39;s got a lot of personality and is pretty versatile, since any lucky minifigure&nbsp;could find her lamp!</p>\\r\\n',\n",

Her facial expression is nice as well, with silver sparkling star details on her cheek and a winking smile with silver lipstick. Her hair piece is the same as the Dino Tracker done in blonde, and she&#39;s got the lamp accessory of course. My one and only complaint is that she doesn&#39;t include a double-sided facial print.

       "    'review': '<p>In my quest to review Series 12, almost every figure has fallen&nbsp;into one of two categories: bad, and good. There&#39;s only been two bad figures, and all the rest have been fantastic, in my opinion. However, the Genie Girl is interesting in the fact that she isn&#39;t very interesting... meaning, she&#39;s nether bad, nor insanely great. She retailed&nbsp;for 4 dollars&nbsp;when she released in 2014.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>On top is a hair piece that was introduced with this series. It was included in dark brown with the Dino Tracker, but here, it&#39;s caste in light blonde, which definitely does match the rest of the figure. I prefer this long, single pony-tail design over the standard one LEGO still uses to this day, even though it looks hecka outdated. This hair piece has some intricate strands of hair, as well as a nice, tight bun at the top. I love this hair mould, and I want to see it used more often in LEGO.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Her face print, while it is admittedly pretty adorable, could have been a lot more useful if it didn&#39;t have silver sparkles and blue lipstick. I can excuse it however, because I will admit, it adds to the figures overall aesthetic. I like her wink, since we don&#39;t see a crazy lot of winking expressions in the CMF line.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This figures torso, while a little suggestive coming from a CMF, has some great printing, and I&#39;m extremely pleased to know it carries onto her back. She uses dual-moulded arms, which are excellent additions, especially with that colour combo of light blue and yellow.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Her leg attachment was originally introduced in Series 6&#39;s Genie, however this has exclusive silver sparkles printed around the front. Nothing is integrated on the back of that piece, but I can excuse it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Her accessory, which is a golden lamp, was also introduced in the Series 6 Genie, and I will admit, it&#39;s a very fitting inclusion.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Overall, I question the choice of this character. It&#39;s a gender swap of the Series 6 Genie, but it&#39;s quite different in aesthetic and design, so no problems there. I adore the hairpiece, as well as the back torso printing, but something about the figure doesn&#39;t exactly stand out to me. She scores a 3 out of 5.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That&#39;s it for this review. I hope it was helpful, thanks for reading!</p>\\r\\n',\n",
